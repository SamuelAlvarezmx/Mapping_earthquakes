# Mapping_earthquakes

## Overview

In this project it wass created an interactive map that would help you visualize earthquakes that happened in the past 7 days. This page will let you visualize three different type of maps:

* Sattellite
* Street
* Dark

Also with the interactive Menu you can see all earthquakes, Major earthquakes that have a Richter value over 4.5 of scale. An added layer will let you see where are the tectonic plates located in the map so you can relate places with more sismic activity with the location of the plates.
